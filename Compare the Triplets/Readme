0Alice and Bob each created one problem for HackerRank. A reviewer rates the two challenges, awarding points on a scale from 1 to 100  for three categories: problem clarity, originality, and difficulty.

We define the rating for Alice's challenge to be the tripleta=(a[0],a[1],a[2]) and b=b(b[0],b[1],b[2] the rating for Bob's challenge to be the triplet .

Your task is to find their comparison points by comparing  with ,  with , and  with .

If a[i]>b[i] , then Alice is awarded  point.
If b[i] > a[i] , then Bob is awarded  point.
If a[i]=b[i] , then neither person receives a point.
Comparison points is the total points a person earned.

Given a and b, determine their respective comparison points.

Function Description

Complete the function compareTriplets in the editor below. It must return an array of two integers, the first being Alice's score and the second being Bob's.

compareTriplets has the following parameter(s):

a: an array of integers representing Alice's challenge rating
b: an array of integers representing Bob's challenge rating
Input Format

The first line contains  space-separated integers,a[0],a[1],and a[2],describing the respective values in triplet .
The second line contains  space-separated integers,b[0],b[1],and b[2],describing the respective values in triplet .

Constraints
1 <= a[i] <= 100
1 <= b[i] <= 100

Output Format

Return an array of two integers denoting the respective comparison points earned by Alice and Bob.

Sample Input 0

5 6 7
3 6 10
Sample Output 0

1 1
Explanation 0

In this example:
a=(a[0],a[1],a[2])=(5,6,7)
b=(b[0],b[1],b[2])=(3,6,10)
Now, let's compare each individual score:

a[0]>b[0],so Alice receives  point.
a[1]=b[1],so nobody receives a point.
a[2]<b[2],so Bob receives  point.
Alice's comparison score is 1,and Bob's comparison score is 1. Thus, we return the array [1,1].

Sample Input 1

17 28 30
99 16 8
Sample Output 1

2 1
